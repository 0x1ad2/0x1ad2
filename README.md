  👋🏻 Welcome to my profile

<p>
  I'm Dennis, 28 years old and living in the

  <b>Zwolle, The Netherlands</b><br /><br />
    Ever since I was a little kid, software development has been my passion, at first I wasn’t
    sure what exactly I wanted to do in the field (IT) but when I wrote my first lines of code
    and executed them something “clicked”.

    From there on I pursued my career in software development with a focus on web. Now,
    eight years later I’m a T-shaped programmer with a broad interest in micro and
    cloud-architecture, mobile apps, and UI/UX design.

    Over the years I’ve worked with a handful of companies in various roles from back-end
    developer to platform architect and everything in between.

    I have an eye for detail; I’m inquisitive, a team player, and always striving to reach my
    goals. I love to coach others, see them grow, and try to reach their full potential. -- A
    self-labeled geek that liked to go to conferences, organise meetups, always ready for
    the next technical challenge!

    I’m an expert in JavaScript (e.g, TypeScript, React, Gatsby, Next and NodeJS) I can work
    with React Native, Angular, Ionic and Electron, I love to host my projects on AWS, view
    designs in Figma and improve my applications based on data driven insights.
